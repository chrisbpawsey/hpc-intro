We now know most of the basic mechanics of getting research up and running on an HPC system.
We can log on, submit different types of jobs, use preinstalled software, 
and install and use software of our own.
What we need to do now is understand how we can use the systems effectively.

## Estimating required resources using the scheduler

Although we covered requesting resources from the scheduler earlier,
how do we know how much and what type of resources we will need in the first place?

Answer: we don't. 
Not until we've tried it ourselves at least once.
We'll need to benchmark our job and experiment with it before
we know how much it needs in the way of resources.

The most effective way of figuring out how much resources a job needs is to submit a test job,
and then ask the scheduler how many resources it used.
A good rule of thumb is to ask the scheduler for more time than your job can use.
This value is typically two to three times what you think your job will need.

Once the job completes, we can query the scheduler to see how long our job took.
We will use `qstat -x` to get statistics about our job.

By itself, `qstat -x -u yourUsername` shows all jobs that you have run on the system recently

```
[remote]$ qstat -x -u yourUsername
```
{: .bash}
```

Comparing the `Req'd Time` and `Elap Time` columns allows you to see if a particular 
job completed within the requested time. If the two values are the same then this 
usually means that the job hit the limit of specified walltime resources rather than
completing successfully (you will see a message in the `.e` file if you have hit the 
walltime limit). If the elapsed time is less than the requested time then 
your job completed (either successfully or not!) within the requested time. In this case,
you will need to check the output files from the job to understand if it ran successfully
or not.

## Measuring the statistics of currently running tasks

As we saw in the previous episode on the scheduler, you can use the `qstat` command to 
monitor how much time and how many nodes are being used by current jobs. To list
details of your jobs (queued and running), use `qstat -u yourUsernname` and to list the
details of all jobs in the queue use `qstat -a`.
