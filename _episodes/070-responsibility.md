One of the major differences between using remote HPC resources and your own system 
(e.g. your laptop) is that they are a shared resource. How many users the resource is
shared between at any one time varies from system to system but it is unlikely you
will ever be the only user logged into or using such a system.

We have already mentioned one of the consequences of this shared nature of the resources:
the scheduling system where you submit your jobs, but their are other things you need 
to consider in order to be a considerate HPC citizen.

## Be kind to the login nodes

The login node is often very busy managing lots of users logged in, creating and editing files
and compiling software! It doesn’t have any extra space to run computational work.

Don’t run jobs on the login node (though quick tests are generally fine). A “quick test” is
generally anything that uses less than 4GB of memory, 4 CPUs, and 10 minutes of time. If you
use too much resource then other users on the login node will start to be affected - their
login sessions will start to run slowly and may even freeze or hang.

You can always use the command `ps ux` to list the processes you are running on a login
node and the amount of CPU and memory they are using. The `kill` command can be used along
with the *PID* to terminate any processes that are using large amounts of resource.

```
[remote]$ module load anaconda/python2
[remote]$ python cfd.py 100 10000 &
[remote]$ ps ux
```
{: .bash}
```

The python command with PID 61091 is using a large amount of CPU (87.5%) so we probably
should kill it:

```
[remote]$ kill 61091
[remote]$ ps ux
```
{: .bash}
```

If you experience performance issues with a login node you should report it to the system
staff (usually via the helpdesk) for them to investigate. You can use the `top` command
to see which users are using which resources.

## Test before scaling

Remember that you are generally charged for usage on shared systems. A simple mistake in a 
job script can end up costing a large amount of resource budget. Imagine a job script with 
a mistake that makes it sit doing nothing for 24 hours on 1000 cores or one where you have
requested 2000 cores by mistake and only use 100 of them! This problem can be compounded 
when people write scripts that automate job submission (for example, when running the same
calculation or analysis over lots of different input).  When this happens it hurts both you
(as you waste lots of charged resource) and other users (who are blocked from accessing the
idle compute nodes).

On very busy resources you may wait many days in a queue for your job to fail within 10 seconds
of starting due to a trivial typo in the job script. This is extremely frustrating! Most
systems provide small, short queues for testing that have short wait times to help you 
avoid this issue.

> Before submitting a very large or very long job submit a short trunctated test to ensure that
> the job starts as expected

## Have a backup plan

Although many HPC systems keep backups, it does not always cover all the file systems available
and may only be for disaster recovery purposes (*i.e.* for restoring the whole file system if lost
rather than an individual file or directory you have deleted by mistake). Your data on the
system is primarily your responsibility and you should ensure you have secure copies of data
that are critical to your work.

Version control systems (such as Git) often have free, cloud-based offerings (e.g. Github, Gitlab)
that are generally used for storing source code. Even if you are not writing your own 
programs, these can be very useful for storing job scripts, analysis scripts and small
input files. 

For larger amounts of data, you should make sure you have a robust system in place for taking
copies of critical data off the HPC system wherever possible to backed-up storage. Tools such
as `rsync` can be very useful for this.

Your access to the shared HPC system will generally be time-limited so you should ensure you have a
plan for transferring your data off the system before your access finishes. The time required to
transfer large amounts of data should not be underestimated and you should ensure you have planned
for this early enough (ideally, before you even start using the system for your research).

In all these cases, the helpdesk of the system you are using shoud be able to provide useful
guidance on your options for data transfer for the volumes of data you will be using.

## Save time

* Compress files before transferring to save file transfer times with large datasets.  

* The less resources you ask for, the faster your jobs will find a slot in which to run.
  Lots of small jobs generally beat a couple big jobs.

## Software tips

* You can generally install software yourself, but if you want a shared installation of some kind,
  it might be a good idea to message an administrator.

* Always use the default compilers if possible. Newer compilers are great, but older stuff generally
  has less compatibility issues.
