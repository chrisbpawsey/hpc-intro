This course provides an introduction to High Performance Computing (HPC). After completing this course, participants will:

* Understand motivations for using HPC in research
* Understand how HPC systems are put together to achieve performance and how they differ from desktops/laptops
* Know how to connect to remote HPC systems and transfer data
* Know how to use a scheduler to work on a shared system
* Be able to use software modules to access different HPC software
* Be able to work effectively on a remote shared resource

This course is being run with support from the [Hartree Centre](/https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx) and [IBM Research](http://www.research.ibm.com/).
