This course provides an introduction to High Performance Computing (HPC). After completing this course, participants will:

* Understand motivations for using HPC in research
* Understand how HPC systems are put together to achieve performance and how they differ from desktops/laptops
* Know how to connect to remote HPC systems and transfer data
* Know how to use a scheduler to work on a shared system
* Be able to use software modules to access different HPC software
* Be able to work effectively on a remote shared resource

This course is being run with support from the [ARCHER National Supercomputing Service](http://www.archer.ac.uk), [The University of Leeds](http://www.leeds.ac.uk) and [IBM Research](http://www.research.ibm.com/).
